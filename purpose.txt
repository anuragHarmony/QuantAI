I want to make an automated quant tool To build that - So let's say I have a quant book - the tool should be able to extract learnings from the book ( including examples ) and make it a knowledge base Then if I add another book - it should be able to do the same - but in a heirarchical manner - broad topics - narrower topics - detailed explaination/example Now let's say i give it a case - to make a model based on the learnings and find pnl based on historical data of n stocks - It should be able to utilize book based knowledge as backbone to build explainable models from the data - make signals to buy and sell then backtest and report pnl
