# Module 7: Simulation Engine

## 🎯 Goal
Three modes: 1) Record live data, 2) Live trade, 3) Replay for backtesting

## 📋 Key Tasks
1. Data recording system (tick-by-tick to Parquet)
2. Event replay engine (with timing preservation)
3. Simulated execution (instant fills with realistic slippage)
4. Performance analysis and metrics
5. Comparison: live vs simulation

## Estimated Time: 3 days
